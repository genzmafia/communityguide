# GZM Community Guide (unofficial)

Welcome! Here you'll find suggestions on how to get started on a variety of topics, mostly for free, as well as a list of people on the Discord to reach out to.

Have knowledge of some topic (non-technical included) you'd like to share? Learn something from others on the server that could be useful to write down? Add it!

[Free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) is a pretty comprehensive resource for learning web development. It's intended to be started from zero and has enough material to get to an entry-level of expertise in full-stack development using popular frameworks like React, Express, and Bootstrap.

[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a great way to get started hacking using the below resources; it comes with most of the packages you'll need without configuration and also comes with free access to GPUs, substantially speeding up many ML workflows compared to consumer hardware.

### Deep Learning
For deep learning specifically, the simplest way to get started is with the [fastai MOOC](https://course.fast.ai/). It only requires a bit of Python and high school math, and gets you building deep neural nets in things like image recognition and NLP with decently modern techniques.
From there the deeplearning.ai [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#courses) may be a good further step, or you can just start diving into reading research papers/hacking, searching anything you don't know on the web.

### General ML
A free introduction to machine learning is Andrew Ng's course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). However, if you can afford purchasing a book (or can acquire the book through other means,) *Hands-On Machine Learning* by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron is excellent, and covers a lot of things the MOOC doesn't, like decision trees.

### Cryptographic Security
[Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) is a set of programming challenges centered around real-world cryptographic attacks. While they require programming ability, the math is not very high-level, at least for the first few challenges, and covers fundamental concepts such as RSA, key exchange, and hash collisions.
