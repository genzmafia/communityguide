[Follow us on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/genzmafia)
GenZMafia is a community of young builders!

Welcome! Here you'll find suggestions on how to get started on a variety of topics, mostly for free, as well as a list of technical resources to transform your project -> product -> company.

## GZM Projects/Products

- This is a public view of things being built by GenZMafia [It's Time To Build](https://airtable.com/shrpyCBZF14uUUDkz)
  - This serves as a single source of truth on who is working on what and the community can benefit from it to ask for advice/questions/help from certain people that are working or have expertise in certain areas.
  - Are you part of GZM Discord and want to add yourself to this list? Follow the steps below!

2. Once in Airtable, go to the orange 'It's time to build' Airtable button under 'bases shared with me'
3. On the right side if there is an 'Install an App' popup, click 'x' on the top right side to make it go away
4. Fill out the details of your product/project
5. **To enforce accountability** the Airtable is configured to update name of the Editor that updated the Airtable with a timestamp reflecting the latest change at the end of the row

## Founder Resources

[High Output Founders Library](https://www.notion.so/High-Output-Founders-Library-48742928f9f149b8a777e11a1409ce0a)
- This resource is a collection of guides put together by [Steve Schlafman](https://schlaf.me/) and [Rishi Tripathy](http://twitter.com/rishi_tripathy_) as an online center of gravity for actionable and practical advice. A lot of these are public resources scattered all over the VC world and this Notion page just brings it all together.
- For example: checkout the 'self' section to find useful advice on how you can grow as your startup grows.

- Look at the check size, type of fund, and notes on VCs.

[Glassdoor for VCs](vcguide.co)
- We generally need some form of accountability for everyone. US gov't is built on a system of checks and balances and so should be entrepreneurship and capitalism in the tech industry.
- Take this guide with a grain of salt on what's said here but every once in a while there is a constant trend about a person and this proves to be useful in that context.
- We suggest to look at posts with detailed and constructive feedback.

[Free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) is a pretty comprehensive resource for learning web development. It's intended to be started from zero and has enough material to get to an entry-level of expertise in full-stack development using popular frameworks like React, Express, and Bootstrap.

[Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja/featured) very useful MERN stack tutorials. Also has videos on Flutter, Firebase, Vue, Python, etc.

## AI/ML/Deep Learning

[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a great way to get started hacking using the below resources; it comes with most of the packages you'll need without configuration and also comes with free access to GPUs, substantially speeding up many ML workflows compared to consumer hardware.

### Deep Learning
For deep learning specifically, the simplest way to get started is with the [fastai MOOC](https://course.fast.ai/). It only requires a bit of Python and high school math, and gets you building deep neural nets in things like image recognition and NLP with decently modern techniques.
From there the deeplearning.ai [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#courses) may be a good further step, or you can just start diving into reading research papers/hacking, searching anything you don't know on the web.

### General ML
A free introduction to machine learning is Andrew Ng's course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). However, if you can afford purchasing a book (or can acquire the book through other means,) *Hands-On Machine Learning* by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron is excellent, and covers a lot of things the MOOC doesn't, like decision trees.

## Crypto/Blockchain

- [Crypto Cave](https://techunity.dev/) started recently to hold quality conversations around crypto by a GZMer [Adam Patel](https://twitter.com/adampatel23).

### Cryptographic Security
[Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) is a set of programming challenges centered around real-world cryptographic attacks. While they require programming ability, the math is not very high-level, at least for the first few challenges, and covers fundamental concepts such as RSA, key exchange, and hash collisions.
