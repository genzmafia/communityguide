GenZMafia is a community of young builders!</p>
<p>Welcome! Here you'll find suggestions on how to get started on a variety of topics, mostly for free, as well as a list of technical resources to transform your project -&gt; product -&gt; company.</p>
<h2 id="gzm-projectsproducts">GZM Projects/Products</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is a public view of things being built by GenZMafia <a href="https://airtable.com/shrpyCBZF14uUUDkz">It's Time To Build</a></li>
<li>This serves as a single source of truth on who is working on what and the community can benefit from it to ask for advice/questions/help from certain people that are working or have expertise in certain areas.</li>
<li>Are you part of GZM Discord and want to add yourself to this list? Follow the steps below!</li>

<li>Once in Airtable, go to the orange 'It's time to build' Airtable button under 'bases shared with me'</li>
<li>On the right side if there is an 'Install an App' popup, click 'x' on the top right side to make it go away</li>
<li>Fill out the details of your product/project</li>
<li><strong>To enforce accountability</strong> the Airtable is configured to update name of the Editor that updated the Airtable with a timestamp reflecting the latest change at the end of the row</li>

<ul>
<li>This resource is a collection of guides put together by <a href="https://schlaf.me/">Steve Schlafman</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/rishi_tripathy_">Rishi Tripathy</a> as an online center of gravity for actionable and practical advice. A lot of these are public resources scattered all over the VC world and this Notion page just brings it all together.</li>
<li>For example: checkout the 'self' section to find useful advice on how you can grow as your startup grows.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="vcguide.co">Glassdoor for VCs</a></p>
<ul>
<li>We generally need some form of accountability for everyone. US gov't is built on a system of checks and balances and so should be entrepreneurship and capitalism in the tech industry.</li>
<li>Take this guide with a grain of salt on what's said here but every once in a while there is a constant trend about a person and this proves to be useful in that context.</li>
<li>We suggest to look at posts with detailed and constructive feedback.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">Free code camp</a> is a pretty comprehensive resource for learning web development. It's intended to be started from zero and has enough material to get to an entry-level of expertise in full-stack development using popular frameworks like React, Express, and Bootstrap.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja/featured">Net Ninja</a> very useful MERN stack tutorials. Also has videos on Flutter, Firebase, Vue, Python, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Colab</a> is a great way to get started hacking using the below resources; it comes with most of the packages you'll need without configuration and also comes with free access to GPUs, substantially speeding up many ML workflows compared to consumer hardware.</p>
<h3 id="deep-learning">Deep Learning</h3>
<p>For deep learning specifically, the simplest way to get started is with the <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">fastai MOOC</a>. It only requires a bit of Python and high school math, and gets you building deep neural nets in things like image recognition and NLP with decently modern techniques.
From there the deeplearning.ai <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#courses">specialization</a> may be a good further step, or you can just start diving into reading research papers/hacking, searching anything you don't know on the web.</p>
<h3 id="general-ml">General ML</h3>
<p>A free introduction to machine learning is Andrew Ng's course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Coursera</a>. However, if you can afford purchasing a book (or can acquire the book through other means,) <em>Hands-On Machine Learning</em> by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron is excellent, and covers a lot of things the MOOC doesn't, like decision trees.</p>

<h3 id="cryptographic-security">Cryptographic Security</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptopals.com/">Cryptopals</a> is a set of programming challenges centered around real-world cryptographic attacks. While they require programming ability, the math is not very high-level, at least for the first few challenges, and covers fundamental concepts such as RSA, key exchange, and hash collisions.</p>
