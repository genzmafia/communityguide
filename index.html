<p>Welcome! Here you'll find suggestions on how to get started on a variety of topics, mostly for free, as well as a list of people on the Discord to reach out to.</p>
<p>Have knowledge of some topic (non-technical included) you'd like to share? Learn something from others on the server that could be useful to write down? Add it!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">Free code camp</a> is a pretty comprehensive resource for learning web development. It's intended to be started from zero and has enough material to get to an entry-level of expertise in full-stack development using popular frameworks like React, Express, and Bootstrap.</p>

<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/">Colab</a> is a great way to get started hacking using the below resources; it comes with most of the packages you'll need without configuration and also comes with free access to GPUs, substantially speeding up many ML workflows compared to consumer hardware.</p>
<h3 id="deep-learning">Deep Learning</h3>
<p>For deep learning specifically, the simplest way to get started is with the <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">fastai MOOC</a>. It only requires a bit of Python and high school math, and gets you building deep neural nets in things like image recognition and NLP with decently modern techniques.
From there the deeplearning.ai <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning#courses">specialization</a> may be a good further step, or you can just start diving into reading research papers/hacking, searching anything you don't know on the web.</p>
<h3 id="general-ml">General ML</h3>
<p>A free introduction to machine learning is Andrew Ng's course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Coursera</a>. However, if you can afford purchasing a book (or can acquire the book through other means,) <em>Hands-On Machine Learning</em> by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron is excellent, and covers a lot of things the MOOC doesn't, like decision trees.</p>

<h3 id="cryptographic-security">Cryptographic Security</h3>
<p><a href="https://cryptopals.com/">Cryptopals</a> is a set of programming challenges centered around real-world cryptographic attacks. While they require programming ability, the math is not very high-level, at least for the first few challenges, and covers fundamental concepts such as RSA, key exchange, and hash collisions.</p>
